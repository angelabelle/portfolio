      <br>
      <br> I was inspired by artists, like Mishka Henner, where she captured images from Google Maps and reimagined them. Having an aerial view is a point of view that we normally don't see. It led me to the idea of making
      composite art from the mappings of where I grew up and where I was born. Both these places are special to me, but they are far from the same.
      <br><br> I used the pen tool to cut out parts of each map and put them together. Grabbing different structures and roads, even bodies of waters allowed me to compare and contrast in ways I never imagined. The map from far away, looks normal,
      but is composed in ways that are non functional; You would not find your way with this newly structured map. But for me, looking closely, I know where every part came from and makes me think of home, and who I am today. I included the idea
      of CMYK processing to my project, to connect the idea of an image and how it's made up of these 4 different combinations of colors, but somehow come together to make the picture concrete.
