      <br><br> The idea is that some people feel like they're trapped in their minds. They feel like the whole world is coming at them. They start overthinking, and making truths from imagination. But for the most part, it's all in their heads,
      and they should just let go. I wanted this to be installed in a large black plexiglass box in the middle of the room, enough to fit one human inside comfortably. The headphones would be placed inside and you would put them on when you enter.
      The sound would start playing. First of all, you're in a black box, with no light to enter, so discomfort might already be triggered. I recorded sounds of tapping and things that might make you wonder what was happening. I also recorded me
      whispering, playing on the idea of "voices in your head". Sometimes I over think a lot of things and create a fear that is not even real, and I'm sure that others go through this too.
