            I had inspiration from the artists during a lecture, like Mishka Henner, where she captured images from Google Maps and reimagined them. Having an aerial view is a point of view that we normally don't see. It led me to the idea of making composite art from the mappings of where I grew up and where I was born. Both these places are special to me, but they are far from the same.
<br><br>
             I used the pen tool to cut out parts of each map and put them together. Grabbing different structures and roads, even bodies of waters allowed me to compare and contrast in ways I never imagined. The map from far away, looks normal, but is composed in ways that are non functional; You would not find your way with this newly structured map. But for me, looking closely, I know where every part came from and makes me think of home, and who I am today. I included the idea of CMYK processing to my project, to connect the idea of an image and how it's made up of these 4 different combinations of colors, but somehow come together to make the picture concrete.

          <p id = "description">   There's always this reoccurring topic when working with digital media; the idea of Nature versus man-made and whether or not our works are too far from the natural. But I find that we, as artists, always reconnect those ideas somehow.
            <br><br>I always liked this picture I took from the Sutro Baths, where it captures the waves from the inside of a cave, with light reflecting off the surface of the water and contrasting against the intensely dark cave. It already diluted the idea of "natural". I wanted to stretch that idea out even further with this project by trying to remove the natural qualities of this picture. I used photoshop to drag out lines of pixels with the marquee tool and take out shapes with the polygonal lasso tool from the photo to already "damage" it's appearance. I then went into Textedit to remove and add some text for the final image [learned from Andrew Blanton]. I did that in 3 stages mainly because I was scared I would corrupt the data. But I actually liked how the 3 stages looked together, and I included them as a GIF. Even converting it into a GIF gave it another textured look because it could not render all the different colors from the image. <br><br>Happy accidents.

          <br><br> As a team we captured video on campus that played around with light and shadows. Along this journey,
            I found that most of the light source was made by electricy because it was shot at night. It inspired
           me to think about our society and how we function with and without electricity/devices. We almost
      panic in an event of a world crisis, or emergency. It also brought me back to when the power grid
        was shut off in San Diego for a whole day. I took notice on how much we rely on this source for
          survival. It scares me to think our society today might go mad in a world without technology and
        electricity. Could we make it if we all fell off the grid?

          <p id = "description">I like the idea of random and changing pieces of art. I wanted to embed that into the piece. In the code, you can find more than one "random ()" function. It allows you to see the beauty in things that are not predetermined to be in a specific time or place. As you hold down the mouse button, random triangles appear. When you move your cursor across the piece, it also manipulates different parts of the project. And at the end, you can hold down spacebar to pause and create your own art.

            <br>      I used Atom, Javascript, HTML, CSS to develop this project.  The malfunction of technology interests me, especially when society relies on it so much. In this project I focused on the CAPTCHA aspect of the web.
          It’s always frustrating when you don’t correctly put the right CAPTCHA the first time around. Every time after is a nuisance. Usually it’s because we rush it or we really can’t read the text. So the following rounds, we make adjustments to ourselves. We start over compensating, by slowing down, and double or even triple checking what we input before we hit “enter”.  And after we do that, it should work, right? Well, with the website I’ll be creating, there will never be a right input. I will set it so the algorithm will always state as “false” never allowing you to get past the CAPTCHA, even if you correctly put in the right text that appears. It will be a funny experience seeing people interact with it.

            <br>Time is currency and currency nowadays is evaluated as something important. Time in that sense, is  something we need to think wisely about, whether we spend it all at once, where we spend it, how we spend it, and who we spend it with. With the internet more accessible and “vital” to the growth to our society, it’s easier to put all our time into it. But there are issues that are rising, are you spending your time well on the internet? Have you gained any knowledge? Can you make a difference? All that we need to be is aware. Be aware of what you are doing with your time

One extension replaces most of the images on the website with images relating money and time, another extension has black squares that popup as you move your mouse on the page, and the other replaces “S” with “$”. It inhibits you from navigating through the site effectively, eventually blacking it out. It also blacks out the images of the money at the same time. Part of this project is connected to the idea that our time is money, and in the way I made it, you can now visualize the your time as money on the webpage and how easy it is to lose track of that.
<br> <br>
Another extension redirects you after 30 seconds on one page. It shoots you over to webpages with information about the Sesta Fosta Bill, Net Neutrality, and USA News, things that many of us do not know about, but should know key in to, and then restarts the loop of browsing.
