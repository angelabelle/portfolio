        I am a mixed-media artist in a time where the world lives and breathes technology. While using oils, watercolor, found material, and graphite in my previous work, I have found myself gravitating towards the digital world. In my most recent
        works, they focus on how technology can be helpful and diminishing simultaneously.
        <br> <br>
        My work is inspired by the world that surrounds me. I notice how taking a week submerged in nature can emit blissfulness; How people are sitting next to each other engaging with their phones more than with each other; How social media has
        the power to influence the generations before and after to do great and horrible things.
        <br> <br>
        Technology is powerful. Period. It can bring and send information in a couple of clicks and it allows society to generate ideas and share them to people across the globe. This results in a world of creativity. And currently, the flow of
        information has never been quicker or easier. But, not all of society is using technology to its advantage. We can be so reliant on technology that we begin to diminish our memory and our time in real space. Technology has given us the tools
        to create, destroy, manipulate almost anything. But society needs to be aware of their time with it, and should try to use it in a way that would allow them and others to excel in life. The juxtaposition of nature versus technology, and
        technology versus human in my work points towards these issues.
