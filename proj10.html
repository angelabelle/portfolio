    My work showcases a composite based installation consisting of mixed-media and found material. Being an artist, I feel that our ideas will always transform, and expand; That our art is affected by the friends, peers, and icons that surround us. We do not realize it instantly, but our methods of creation are being altered, constantly. I want to bring that concept into the gallery space by allowing the viewers to interact with and rearrange the pieces. The installation can be created into an entirely different piece and a part of what the viewer creates will be an entity of my own. It will be exciting to see how the installation will be altered. New connections will occur and accidents may happen. Itâ€™s scary to think that change always occurs, but it is the most beautiful instance when you allow it to happen.
