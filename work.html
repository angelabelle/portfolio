            <br> This image marked my journey to leave "home" and come to San Jose. My last get away was heading out to Yosemite, and diving into nature before I was fully engulfed by technology. I was also accompanied by my significant other and his
            younger siblings. The differnet elements involved with my trip let me reflect on my youth, innocence, and the realization of how much more there is to experience. This unfamiliar scope had let to new connections.
            <br><br> I first photographed a young girl named Evelyn. She was a concurrently a symbol of energy and calmness. I invested my time in creating an illustrated image using the photo as a reference. I created my own color palette, and added
            textures to allow the work to seem less flat. I used programs like Photoshop and Illustrator.

            <br> I was inspired by artists, like Mishka Henner, where she captured images from Google Maps and reimagined them. Having an aerial view is a point of view that we normally don't see. It led me to the idea of making
            composite art from the mappings of where I grew up and where I was born. Both these places are special to me, but they are far from the same.
            <br><br> I used the pen tool to cut out parts of each map and put them together. Grabbing different structures and roads, even bodies of waters allowed me to compare and contrast in ways I never imagined. The map from far away, looks normal,
            but is composed in ways that are non functional; You would not find your way with this newly structured map. But for me, looking closely, I know where every part came from and makes me think of home, and who I am today. I included the idea
            of CMYK processing to my project, to connect the idea of an image and how it's made up of these 4 different combinations of colors, but somehow come together to make the picture concrete.

              <p id="description"> There's always this reoccurring topic when working with digital media; the idea of Nature versus man-made and whether or not our works are too far from the natural. But I find that we, as artists, always reconnect those ideas somehow.
                <br><br>I always liked this picture I took from the Sutro Baths, where it captures the waves from the inside of a cave, with light reflecting off the surface of the water and contrasting against the intensely dark cave. It already diluted
                the idea of "natural". I wanted to stretch that idea out even further with this project by trying to remove the natural qualities of this picture. I used photoshop to drag out lines of pixels with the marquee tool and take out shapes with
                the polygonal lasso tool from the photo to already "damage" it's appearance. I then went into Textedit to remove and add some text for the final image [learned from Andrew Blanton]. I did that in 3 stages mainly because I was scared I
                would corrupt the data. But I actually liked how the 3 stages looked together, and I included them as a GIF. Even converting it into a GIF gave it another textured look because it could not render all the different colors from the image.
                <br><br>Happy accidents.

          <p id="description">
            <br><br> I captured parts of campus that played around with light and shadows with a group. Along this journey, I found that most of the light source was made by electricy because it was shot at night. It inspired me to think about our society
            and how we function with and without electricity/devices. We almost panic in an event of a world crisis, or emergency. It also brought me back to when the power grid was shut off in San Diego for a whole day. I took notice on how much we rely
            on this source for survival. It scares me to think our society today might go mad in a world without technology and electricity. Could we make it if we all fell off the grid?

            create your own art.

          <p id="description">
            <br> The question “Are you human?” automatically makes me think of the Captcha. And you can find these on a lot of websites. They are basically algorithms, which weed out any bots from humans and make sure that they don’t enter. I wanted to
            take this to the physical world. I focused on the image selecting Captcha. I would create a template of different formats and laminate it. My first set of physical captchas involved the on going question "What is art?". Instead of asking you
            to select images of stop signs or cars, it asked you to "Select the images of art". It included different forms of art, some too well known like the Mona Lisa, some not to well known, and forms of art that are in question. Like, if it's functional,
            is it considered art? Or, if it's made for the purpose of religion, is that a form of art or is it just a function of depicting God for the followers?
            <br> <br> I placed them around campus and allowed the audience to decide. By the end of the first week in the art building, Almost all of the options were selected. In the business building, only the most well known ones were checked off.
            It is always interesting to see the changes of art, and the changes in the idea of what art is during our time now.

            <br>Time is currency and currency nowadays is evaluated as something important. Time in that sense, is something we need to think wisely about, whether we spend it all at once, where we spend it, how we spend it, and who we spend it with.
            With the internet more accessible and “vital” to the growth to our society, it’s easier to put all our time into it. But there are issues that are rising, are you spending your time well on the internet? Have you gained any knowledge? Can
            you make a difference? All that we need to be is aware. Be aware of what you are doing with your time.
            <br> <br> One extension replaces most of the images on the website with images relating money and time, another extension has black squares that popup as you move your mouse on the page, and the other replaces “S” with “$”. It inhibits you
            from navigating through the site effectively, eventually blacking it out. It also blacks out the images of the money at the same time. Part of this project is connected to the idea that our time is money, and in the way I made it, you can
            now visualize the your time as money on the webpage and how easy it is to lose track of that.
            <br> <br> Another extension redirects you after 30 seconds on one page. It shoots you over to webpages with information about the Sesta Fosta Bill, Net Neutrality, and USA News, things that many of us do not know about, but should know key
            in to, and then restarts the loop of browsing.

            <br><br> The idea is that some people feel like they're trapped in their minds. They feel like the whole world is coming at them. They start overthinking, and making truths from imagination. But for the most part, it's all in their heads,
            and they should just let go. I wanted this to be installed in a large black plexiglass box in the middle of the room, enough to fit one human inside comfortably. The headphones would be placed inside and you would put them on when you enter.
            The sound would start playing. First of all, you're in a black box, with no light to enter, so discomfort might already be triggered. I recorded sounds of tapping and things that might make you wonder what was happening. I also recorded me
            whispering, playing on the idea of "voices in your head". Sometimes I over think a lot of things and create a fear that is not even real, and I'm sure that others go through this too.

            <br> I built a composite creator that has pre-cut images, that represent our society and culture today in America. The viewer will be allowed to see the image, and “paste” the image onto the “canvas”.
            They also have the option to change the image’s tint 3 times using the shift button, and reset the canvas using the delete button. It will all be insinuated by the text at the top of the page. For the viewer that is curious, they will begin
            to see things that are not exactly beautiful, things that might be terrifying, and unjust. But they also see the better, wonderful things that make our society great. The viewer creates their own artwork from the good and the bad. They can
            either recognize what is happening, or not know what is going on. The viewers should question the images and text that I have chosen. This piece points to two questions: What can we take from society, and what can we do with it to make it
            better? How can our art do the same?
