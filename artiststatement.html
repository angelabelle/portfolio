            My name is Angelabelle Abarientos. I am an mixed-media artist in a time where the world lives and breathes technology. While using oils, watercolor, found material, and graphite in my previous work, I have found myself gravitating towards the digital world. In my most recent works, they focus on how technology can be helpful and diminishing at the same time.
<br> <br>
My work is inspired from taking in the world that surrounds me. How taking a week submerged in nature and away from the city, can feel blissful; How I notice people sitting next to each other engaging with their phones and not with each other; How social media has had the power to influence the generations before and after us to do great and horrible things.
<br> <br>
Technology is wonderful because it can bring and send information in a couple of clicks and it allows us to generate ideas and share them to people across the globe. This generates a world of creativity. And during our time, the flow of information has never been quicker or easier. But, not all of us are using technology to its advantage. We can be so reliant on technology that we begin to diminish our memory and our time in real space. We have the tools to create, destroy, manipulate almost anything. We need to be aware of our time with technology, and should try to use it in a way that would allow us and others to excel in life. The juxtaposition of nature versus technology, and even technology versus human in my work points towards these issues.
