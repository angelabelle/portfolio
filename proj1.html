        <br> This image marked my journey to leave "home" and come to San Jose. My last get away was heading out to Yosemite, and diving into nature before I was fully engulfed by technology. I was also accompanied by my significant other and his
        younger siblings. The different elements involved with my trip let me reflect on my youth, innocence, and the realization of how much more there is to experience. This unfamiliar scope had let to new connections.
        <br><br> I first photographed a young girl named Evelyn. She was a concurrently a symbol of energy and calmness. I invested my time in creating an illustrated image using the photo as a reference. I created my own color palette, and added
        textures to allow the work to seem less flat. I used programs like Photoshop and Illustrator.
